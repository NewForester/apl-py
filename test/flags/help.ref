APL Shell implemented in Python 3, Copyright 2017 NewForester

Invocation without any flags or arguments will enter an interactive APL shell.
Use an APL command such as )OFF to exit.

Invocation without flags but with arguments will interpret the arguments as
an APL expression, print the result and exit.  Eg:

    $ apl.py 4 8 16 ÷ 2
    2 4 8

Summary of the command line flags recognised by the interpreter:
    -l --log  <file>    log session input and output to <file>
    -f --file <file>    interpret contents of <file> as APL expressions
    -i --input <file>   redirect so that ⎕ and ⍞ are read from <file>
    -o --output <file>  record output from ⎕← and ⍞← in <file>

    -h --help           print this help text and exit
    -h --help [long]    print a lot more help text and exit
    -V --Version        print version information and exit

    -s --silent         suppress interactive output
    -v --verbose        resume interactive output

    --                  ends of flags (what follows are arguments, if any)

Note that at present in the interactive interpreter:

    ^C  (interrupt)     may be used to abort execution and quit the interpreter
    ^D  (end of input)  may be used to exit the interpreter instead of )OFF

This program is still under active development:  any and all features are
'as is' and subject to change.

Your curiosity is much appreciated. Thank you.
